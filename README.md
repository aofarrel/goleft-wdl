# goleft-wdl
Collection of miscellanous WDLized [goleft](https://github.com/brentp/goleft) functions. Please see the [covstats-wdl](https://github.com/aofarrel/covstats-wdl/) repo for covstats.

**indexcov.wdl** is a proof-of-concept. It runs samtools index, covstats, and indexcov on a single bam file input, then reports the read length and coverage along with all of indexcov's usual outputs.
